# Introduction

This repository contains a collection of various Geocaching Mystery Tools and classes. I coded those over time as little helpers 
to solve various mysteries. 

Code is provided as-is without any warranties or promises.

The repository code is not maintained regularly, and often I coded certain methods only until the concrete mystery 
was solved. So alas I can't judge for everything to work correctly. However, it may serve some people good which is why I 
decided to publish it anyway.

Code uses gradle as its build tool. You can use the usual gradle commands on it e.g.
* `gradle test` to compile and run unit tests
